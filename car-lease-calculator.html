For example, a money factor of 0.00125 equals 3% APR (0.00125 × 2400 = 3%). Lower money factors mean lower monthly lease payments. Always ask dealers for the money factor and convert it to APR to compare with loan rates."

If your car is totaled early in the lease, you typically lose any down payment as gap insurance only covers the car's depreciated value, not your upfront payment. It's better to keep that money invested, in an emergency fund, or use it to reduce monthly payments through a higher credit score."

Higher residual values (60-70%) mean lower monthly payments because you're paying for less depreciation. For example, a $30,000 car with 60% residual value means it's worth $18,000 at lease-end, so you only pay for $12,000 of depreciation plus finance charges and tax."

                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">It depends on your financial situation and lifestyle. Leasing offers lower monthly payments, no maintenance worries (under warranty), and flexibility to drive new cars every 2-3 years. Buying builds equity, has no mileage restrictions, and lets you customize freely.

                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">Money factor is the interest rate used in lease calculations, expressed as a small decimal. To convert money factor to APR, multiply by 2400. For example, a money factor of 0.00125 equals 3% APR (0.00125 × 2400 = 3%). Lower money factors mean lower monthly lease payments. Always ask dealers for the money factor and convert it to APR to compare with loan rates.</p>

                        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">Generally, no. Financial experts recommend $0 down on leases. If your car is totaled early in the lease, you typically lose any down payment as gap insurance only covers the car's depreciated value, not your upfront payment. It's better to keep that money invested, in an emergency fund, or use it to reduce monthly payments through a higher credit score.</p>

                        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">Very accurate. Our calculator uses real-time FRED API data for interest rates, standard industry formulas for lease calculations (depreciation + rent charge + tax), and considers all variables: MSRP, negotiated price, residual value, money factor, down payment, trade-in, fees, sales tax, and depreciation. It provides the same calculations dealerships use, plus 20+ AI insights they won't tell you.</p>

                        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">Residual value is the estimated worth of the car at the end of your lease term, expressed as a percentage of MSRP. Higher residual values (60-70%) mean lower monthly payments because you're paying for less depreciation. For example, a $30,000 car with 60% residual value means it's worth $18,000 at lease-end, so you only pay for $12,000 of depreciation plus finance charges and tax.</p>

                        <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">Yes. The calculator includes sales tax in both lease and buy scenarios. For leasing, you typically pay tax on monthly payments only (varies by state). For buying, you pay tax on the full purchase price upfront (minus trade-in). This can significantly impact the total cost comparison, especially in high-tax states like California (7.25%+) or New York (4%+ state plus local).</p>

                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">Absolutely. You can adjust down payments for both lease and buy scenarios to see real-time impacts on monthly payments, total cost, and net worth. The calculator provides separate input fields for lease down payment and buy down payment, allowing precise comparison of different financing strategies. Try multiple scenarios to find the optimal balance for your budget.</p>

                            <p class="faq-answer" itemprop="text">The net worth chart visualizes your financial position over time for both options. For buying, it shows equity as you pay down the loan minus depreciation. For leasing, it shows invested savings (the difference in upfront costs and monthly payments) growing with compound returns at your specified investment return rate. This helps you see which option leaves you wealthier at any point in time.</p>
